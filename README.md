# Digital-LED-Thermometer

The purpose is to explore using an LED bargraph to simulate an old fashioned thermometer using a string of LEDs and a semiconductor temperature sensor.

Goal:
To light-up a string of LEDs based on the temperature from room temperature to anywhere we are able to go, hot or cold.  The LEDs are all on at the highest temp and less in-between depending on the value of the temperature.  If you want it to work with your finger for heating it up and a fan for cooling it down then your numbers will be close to room temperature.  If you want to heat it up more with a soldering iron or a can of compressed air for cooling then your numbers will have to be spread out more.
